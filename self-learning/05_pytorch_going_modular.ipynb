    "# 05. PyTorch Going Modular\n",
    "\n",
    "This section answers the question, \"how do I turn my notebook code into Python scripts?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we're going to turn the most useful code cells in [notebook 04. PyTorch Custom Datasets](https://www.learnpytorch.io/04_pytorch_custom_datasets/) into a series of Python scripts saved to a directory called [`going_modular`](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/main/going_modular).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is going modular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Going modular involves turning notebook code (from a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab notebook) into a series of different Python scripts that offer similar functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could turn our notebook code from a series of cells into the following Python files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data_setup.py` - a file to prepare and download data if needed.\n",
    "* `engine.py` - a file containing various training functions.\n",
    "* `model_builder.py` or `model.py` - a file to create a PyTorch model.\n",
    "* `train.py` - a file to leverage all other files and train a target PyTorch model.\n",
    "* `utils.py` - a file dedicated to helpful utility functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The naming and layout of the above files will depend on your use case and code requirements. Python scripts are as general as individual notebook cells, meaning, you could create one for almost any kind of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why would you want to go modular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are fantastic for iteratively exploring and running experiments quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for larger scale projects you may find Python scripts more reproducible and easier to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this is a debated topic, as companies like [Netflix have shown how they use notebooks for production code](https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production code** is code that runs to offer a service to someone or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have an app running online that other people can access and use, the code running that app is considered **production code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And libraries like fast.ai's [`nb-dev`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) (short for notebook development) enable you to write whole Python libraries (including documentation) with Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and cons of notebooks vs Python scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "There's arguments for both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this list sums up a few of the main topics.\n",

    "### My workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "I usually start machine learning projects in Jupyter/Google Colab notebooks for quick experimentation and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then when I've got something working, I move the most useful pieces of code to Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*There are many possible workflows for writing machine learning code. Some prefer to start with scripts, others (like me) prefer to start with notebooks and go to scripts later on.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch in the wild\n",
    "\n",
    "In your travels, you'll see many code repositories for PyTorch-based ML projects have instructions on how to run the PyTorch code in the form of Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might be instructed to run code like the following in a terminal/command line to train a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python train.py --model MODEL_NAME --batch_size BATCH_SIZE --lr LEARNING_RATE --num_epochs NUM_EPOCHS\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "*Running a PyTorch `train.py` script on the command line with various hyperparameter settings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `train.py` is the target Python script, it'll likely contain functions to train a PyTorch model.\n",
    "\n",
    "And `--model`, `--batch_size`, `--lr` and `--num_epochs` are known as argument flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set these to whatever values you like and if they're compatible with `train.py`, they'll work, if not, they'll error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we wanted to train our TinyVGG model from notebook 04 for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.001:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python train.py --model tinyvgg --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001 --num_epochs 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could setup any number of these argument flags in your `train.py` script to suit your needs.\n",

    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept of this section is: **turn useful notebook code cells into reusable Python files.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this will save us writing the same code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two notebooks for this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**05. Going Modular: Part 1 (cell mode)**](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/going_modular/05_pytorch_going_modular_cell_mode.ipynb) - this notebook is run as a traditional Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab notebook and is a condensed version of [notebook 04](https://www.learnpytorch.io/04_pytorch_custom_datasets/).\n",
    "2. [**05. Going Modular: Part 2 (script mode)**](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/going_modular/05_pytorch_going_modular_script_mode.ipynb) - this notebook is the same as number 1 but with added functionality to turn each of the major sections into Python scripts, such as, `data_setup.py` and `train.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The text in this document focuses on the code cells 05. Going Modular: Part 2 (script mode), the ones with `%%writefile ...` at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why two parts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because sometimes the best way to learn something is to see how it *differs* from something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run each notebook side-by-side you'll see how they differ and that's where the key learnings are.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Running the two notebooks for section 05 side-by-side. You'll notice that the **script mode notebook has extra code cells** to turn code from the cell mode notebook into Python scripts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we're working towards\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section we want to have two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ability to train the model we built in notebook 04 (Food Vision Mini) with one line of code on the command line: `python train.py`.\n",
    "2. A directory structure of reusable Python scripts, such as: \n",

    "**Resources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Exercise template notebook for 05](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/exercises/05_pytorch_going_modular_exercise_template.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Example solutions notebook for 05](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/solutions/05_pytorch_going_modular_exercise_solutions.ipynb)\n",
    "    * Live coding run through of [solutions notebook for 05 on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ijgFhMK3pp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn the code to get the data (from section 1. Get Data above) into a Python script, such as `get_data.py`.\n",
    "    * When you run the script using `python get_data.py` it should check if the data already exists and skip downloading if it does.\n",
    "    * If the data download is successful, you should be able to access the `pizza_steak_sushi` images from the `data` directory.\n",
    "2. Use [Python's `argparse` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to be able to send the `train.py` custom hyperparameter values for training procedures.\n",
    "    * Add an argument for using a different:\n",
    "        * Training/testing directory\n",
    "        * Learning rate\n",
    "        * Batch size\n",
    "        * Number of epochs to train for\n",
    "        * Number of hidden units in the TinyVGG model\n",
    "    * Keep the default values for each of the above arguments as what they already are (as in notebook 05).\n",
    "    * For example, you should be able to run something similar to the following line to train a TinyVGG model with a learning rate of 0.003 and a batch size of 64 for 20 epochs: `python train.py --learning_rate 0.003 --batch_size 64 --num_epochs 20`.\n",
    "    * **Note:** Since `train.py` leverages the other scripts we created in section 05, such as, `model_builder.py`, `utils.py` and `engine.py`, you'll have to make sure they're available to use too. You can find these in the [`going_modular` folder on the course GitHub](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/main/going_modular/going_modular). \n",
    "3. Create a script to predict (such as `predict.py`) on a target image given a file path with a saved model.\n",
    "    * For example, you should be able to run the command `python predict.py some_image.jpeg` and have a trained PyTorch model predict on the image and return its prediction.\n",
    "    * To see example prediction code, check out the [predicting on a custom image section in notebook 04](https://www.learnpytorch.io/04_pytorch_custom_datasets/#113-putting-custom-image-prediction-together-building-a-function). \n",
    "    * You may also have to write code to load in a trained model.\n",

    "## Extra-curriculum\n",

    "* To learn more about structuring a Python project, check out Real Python's guide on [Python Application Layouts](https://realpython.com/python-application-layouts/). \n",
    "* For ideas on styling your PyTorch code, check out the [PyTorch style guide by Igor Susmelj](https://github.com/IgorSusmelj/pytorch-styleguide#recommended-code-structure-for-training-your-model) (much of styling in this chapter is based off this guide + various similar PyTorch repositories).\n",
    "* For an example `train.py` script and various other PyTorch scripts written by the PyTorch team to train state-of-the-art image classification models, check out their [`classification` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/classification). \n"
