    "Someone else being a person who can interact with your model in some way. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, someone taking a photo on their smartphone of food and then having our FoodVision Mini model classify it into pizza, steak or sushi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something else might be another program, app or even another model that interacts with your machine learning model(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a banking database might rely on a machine learning model making predictions as to whether a transaction is fraudulent or not before transferring funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or an operating system may lower its resource consumption based on a machine learning model making predictions on how much power someone generally uses at specific times of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "These use cases can be mixed and matched as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a Tesla car's computer vision system will interact with the car's route planning program (something else) and then the route planning program will get inputs and feedback from the driver (someone else).\n",

    "Deploying a model is as important as training one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because although you can get a pretty good idea of how your model's going to function by evaluting it on a well crafted test set or visualizing its results, you never really know how it's going to perform until you release it to the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having people who've never used your model interact with it will often reveal edge cases you never thought of during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what happens if someone was to upload a photo that *wasn't* of food to our FoodVision Mini model?\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution would be to create another model that first classifies images as \"food\" or \"not food\" and passing the target image through that model first (this is what [Nutrify](https://nutrify.app) does).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if the image is of \"food\" it goes to our FoodVision Mini model and gets classified into pizza, steak or sushi.\n",

    "What happens then?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how these questions could keep going.\n",

    "To check our model's size in bytes, we can use Python's [`pathlib.Path.stat(\"path_to_model\").st_size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.stat) and then we can convert it (roughly) to megabytes by dividing it by `(1024*1024)`. "

When we load the model we'll also set `map_location=torch.device(\"cpu\")` in [`torch.load()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html) so our model gets loaded onto the CPU regardless of the device it trained on (we do this because we won't necessarily have a GPU when we deploy and we'll get an error if our model is trained on GPU but we try to deploy it to CPU without explicitly saying so).\n",
    "3. **Predict function** - Gradio's `gradio.Interface()` takes a `fn` parameter to map inputs to outputs, our `predict()` function will be the same as the one we defined above in [section 7.2: *Creating a function to map our inputs and outputs*](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/#72-creating-a-function-to-map-our-inputs-and-outputs), it will take in an image and then use the loaded transforms to preprocess it before using the loaded model to make a prediction on it.\n",
    "    * **Note:** We'll have to create the example list on the fly via the `examples` parameter. We can do so by creating a list of the files inside the `examples/` directory with: `[[\"examples/\" + example] for example in os.listdir(\"examples\")]`.\n",
    "4. **Gradio app** - This is where the main logic of our demo will live, we'll create a `gradio.Interface()` instance called `demo` to put together our inputs, `predict()` function and outputs. And we'll finish the script by calling `demo.launch()` to launch our FoodVision Mini demo!"

    "## Main takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deployment is as important as training.** Once you’ve got a good working model, your first question should be: how can I deploy this and make it accessible to others? Deployment allows you to test your model in the real world rather than on private training and test sets.\n",
    "* **Three questions for machine learning model deployment:**\n",
    "    1. What’s the most ideal use case for the model (how well and how fast does it perform)?\n",
    "    2. Where’s the model going to go (is it on-device or on the cloud)?\n",
    "    3. How’s the model going to function (are predictions online or offline)?\n",
    "* **Deployment options are a plenty.** But best to start simple. One of the best current ways (I say current because these things are always changing) is to use Gradio to create a demo and host it on Hugging Face Spaces. Start simple and scale up when needed.\n",
    "* **Never stop experimenting.** Your machine learning model needs will likely change overtime so deploying a single model is not the last step. You might find the dataset changes, so you’ll have to update your model. Or new research gets released and there’s a better architecture to use.\n",
    "* **Machine learning model deployment is part of the engineering practice of MLOps (machine learning operations).** MLOps is an extension of DevOps (development operations) and involves all the engineering parts around training a model: data collection and storage, data preprocessing, model deployment, model monitoring, versioning and more. It’s a rapidly evolving field but there are some solid resources out there to learn more, many of which are in [PyTorch Extra Resources](https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_extra_resources/#resources-for-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-engineering)."

    "\n",
    "1. Make and time predictions with both feature extractor models on the test dataset using the GPU (`device=\"cuda\"`). Compare the model's prediction times on GPU vs CPU - does this close the gap between them? As in, does making predictions on the GPU make the ViT feature extractor prediction times closer to the EffNetB2 feature extractor prediction times?\n",
    "    * You'll find code to do these steps in [section 5. Making predictions with our trained models and timing them](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/#5-making-predictions-with-our-trained-models-and-timing-them) and [section 6. Comparing model results, prediction times and size](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/#6-comparing-model-results-prediction-times-and-size).\n",
    "2. The ViT feature extractor seems to have more learning capacity (due to more parameters) than EffNetB2, how does it go on the larger 20% split of the entire Food101 dataset?\n",
    "    * Train a ViT feature extractor on the 20% Food101 dataset for 5 epochs, just like we did with EffNetB2 in section [10. Creating FoodVision Big](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/#10-creating-foodvision-big).\n",
    "3. Make predictions across the 20% Food101 test dataset with the ViT feature extractor from exercise 2 and find the \"most wrong\" predictions.\n",
    "    * The predictions will be the ones with the highest prediction probability but with the wrong predicted label.\n",
    "    * Write a sentence or two about why you think the model got these predictions wrong.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the ViT feature extractor across the whole Food101 test dataset rather than just the 20% version, how does it perform?\n",
    "    * Does it beat the original Food101 paper's best result of 56.4% accuracy?\n",
    "5. Head to [Paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/) and find the current best performing model on the Food101 dataset.\n",
    "    * What model architecture does it use?\n",
    "6. Write down 1-3 potential failure points of our deployed FoodVision models and what some potential solutions might be.\n",
    "    * For example, what happens if someone was to upload a photo that wasn't of food to our FoodVision Mini model?\n",
    "7. Pick any dataset from [`torchvision.datasets`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html) and train a feature extractor model on it using a model from [`torchvision.models`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html) (you could use one of the model's we've already created, e.g. EffNetB2 or ViT) for 5 epochs and then deploy your model as a Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces. \n",
    "    * You may want to pick smaller dataset/make a smaller split of it so training doesn't take too long.\n",
    "    * I'd love to see your deployed models! So be sure to share them in Discord or on the [course GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/discussions)."

    "* For a fanstastic guide on developing AI and ML-powered applications, see [Google's People + AI Guidebook](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook). One of my favourites is the section on [setting the right expectations](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/patterns#set-the-right-expectations).\n",
