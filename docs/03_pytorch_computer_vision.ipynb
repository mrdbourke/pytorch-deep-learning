    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Why do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world you could do the forward pass and backward pass across all of your data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you start using really large datasets, unless you've got infinite computing power, it's easier to break them up into batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also gives your model more opportunities to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **mini-batches** (small portions of the data), gradient descent is performed more often per epoch (once per mini-batch rather than once per epoch).\n",

    "So far we've been writing train and test loops over and over. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write them again but this time we'll put them in functions so they can be called again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because we're using device-agnostic code now, we'll be sure to call `.to(device)` on our feature (`X`) and target (`y`) tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the training loop we'll create a function called `train_step()` which takes in a model, a `DataLoader` a loss function and an optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing loop will be similar but it'll be called `test_step()` and it'll take in a model, a `DataLoader`, a loss function and an evaluation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Since these are functions, you can customize them in any way you like. What we're making here can be considered barebones training and testing functions for our specific classification use case."
