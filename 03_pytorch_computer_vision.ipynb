    "\n",
    "[Computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) is the art of teaching a computer to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it could involve building a model to classify whether a photo is of a cat or a dog ([binary classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#binary-classification)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or whether a photo is of a cat, dog or chicken ([multi-class classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#multi-class-classification)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or identifying where a car appears in a video frame ([object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or figuring out where different objects in an image can be separated ([panoptic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868)).\n",

    "| **3. Model 0: Building a baseline model** | Here we'll create a multi-class classification model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a **loss function**, **optimizer** and build a **training loop**. | \n",
    "| **4. Making predictions and evaluting model 0** | Let's make some predictions with our baseline model and evaluate them. |\n",
    "| **5. Setup device agnostic code for future models** | It's best practice to write device-agnostic code, so let's set it up. |\n",
    "| **6. Model 1: Adding non-linearity** | Experimenting is a large part of machine learning, let's try and improve upon our baseline model by adding non-linear layers. |\n",

    "\n",
    "Because it's more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world you could do the forward pass and backward pass across all of your data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you start using really large datasets, unless you've got infinite computing power, it's easier to break them up into batches.\n",
    "\n",
