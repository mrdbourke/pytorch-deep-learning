    "\n",
    "It also gives your model more opportunities to improve.\n",

Then plot some predictions where the model was wrong alongside what the label of the image should've been. After visualing these predictions do you think it's more of a modelling error or a data error? As in, could the model do better or are the labels of the data too close to each other (e.g. a \"Shirt\" label is too close to \"T-shirt/top\")?"
