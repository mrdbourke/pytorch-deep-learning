    "# (WIP) 03. PyTorch Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "[Computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) is the art of teaching a computer to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it could involve building a model to classify whether a photo is of a cat or a dog ([binary classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#binary-classification)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or whether a photo is of a cat, dog or chicken ([multi-class classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#multi-class-classification)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or identifying where a car appears in a video frame ([object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or figuring out where different objects in an image can be separated ([panoptic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868)).\n",
    "\n",
    "![example computer vision problems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/03-computer-vision-problems.png)\n",
    "*Example computer vision problems for binary classification, multiclass classification, object detection and segmentation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where does computer vision get used?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a smartphone, you've already used computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Camera and photo apps use [computer vision to enhance](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/panoptic-segmentation) and sort images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cars use [computer vision](https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=2989) to avoid other cars and stay within lane lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manufacturers use computer vision to identify defects in various products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security cameras use computer vision to detect potential intruders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, anything that can described in a visual sense can be a potential computer vision problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to apply the PyTorch Workflow we've been learning in the past couple of sections to computer vision.\n",

    "| **Topic** | **Contents** |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| **0. Computer vision libraries in PyTorch** | PyTorch has a bunch of built-in helpful computer vision libraries, let's check them out.  |\n",
    "| **1. Load data** | To practice computer vision, we'll start with some images of different pieces of clothing from [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). |\n",
    "| **2. Prepare data** | We've got some images, let's load them in with a [PyTorch `DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) so we can use them with our training loop. |\n",
    "| **3. Model 0: Building a baseline model** | Here we'll create a multi-class classification model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a **loss function**, **optimizer** and build a **training loop**. | \n",
    "| **4. Making predictions and evaluting model 0** | Let's make some predictions with our baseline model and evaluate them. |\n",
    "| **5. Setup device agnostic code for future models** | It's best practice to write device-agnostic code, so let's set it up. |\n",
    "| **6. Model 1: Adding non-linearity** | Experimenting is a large part of machine learning, let's try and improve upon our baseline model by adding non-linear layers. |\n",
    "| **7. Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | Time to get computer vision specific and introduce the powerful convolutional neural network architecture. |\n",
    "| **8. Comparing our models** | We've built three different models, let's compare them. |\n",
    "| **9. Evaluating our best model** | Let's make some predictons on random images and evaluate our best model. |\n",
    "| **10. Making a confusion matrix** | A confusion matrix is a great way to evaluate a classification model, let's see how we can make one. |\n",
    "| **11. Saving and loading the best performing model** | Since we might want to use our model for later, let's save it and make sure it loads back in correctly. |"

Then plot some predictions where the model was wrong alongside what the label of the image should've been. After visualing these predictions do you think it's more of a modelling error or a data error? As in, could the model do better or are the labels of the data too close to each other (e.g. a \"Shirt\" label is too close to \"T-shirt/top\")?"
