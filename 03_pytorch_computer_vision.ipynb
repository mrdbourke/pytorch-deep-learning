    "# (WIP) 03. PyTorch computer vision\n",
    "\n",
    "[Computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) is the art of teaching a computer to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it could involve building a model to classify whether a photo is of a cat or a dog ([binary classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#binary-classification)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or whether a photo is of a cat, dog or chicken ([multi-class classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#multi-class-classification)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or identifying where a car appears in a video frame ([object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or figuring out where different objects in an image can be separated ([panoptic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where does computer vision get used?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a smartphone, you've already used computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Camera and photo apps use computer vision to enhance and sort images - TK Link: https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/panoptic-segmentation.\n",

    "Modern cars use computer vision to avoid other cars and stay within lane lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manufacturers use computer vision to identify defects in various products.\n",

    "Security cameras use computer vision to detect potential intruders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, anything that can described in a visual sense can be a potential computer vision problem.\n",

    "| **0. Computer vision libraries in PyTorch** | PyTorch has a bunch of built-in helpful computer vision libraries, let's check them out.  |\n",
    "| **1. Load data** | To practice computer vision, we'll start with some images of different pieces of clothing from [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). |\n",
    "| **2. Prepare data** | We've got some images, let's load them in with a [PyTorch `DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) so we can use them with our training loop. |\n",
    "| **3. Model 0: Building a baseline model** | Here we'll create a multi-class classification model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a **loss function**, **optimizer** and build a **training loop**. | \n",
    "| **4. Making predictions and evaluting model 0** | Let's make some predictions with our baseline model and evaluate them. |\n",
    "| **5. Setup device agnostic code for future models** | It's best practice to write device-agnostic code, so let's set it up. |\n",
    "| **6. Model 1: Adding non-linearity** | Experimenting is a large part of machine learning, let's try and improve upon our baseline model by adding non-linear layers. |\n",
    "| **7. Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | Time to get computer vision specific and introduce the powerful convolutional neural network architecture. |\n",
    "| **8. Evaluating our best model** | Let's make some predictons on random images and evaluate our best model. |\n",
    "| **9. Making a confusion matrix** | A confusion matrix is a great way to evaluate a classification model, let's see how we can make one. |\n",
    "| **10. Saving and loading the best performing model** | Since we might want to use our model for later, let's save it and make sure it loads back in correctly. |\n",

    "In an ideal world you could do the forward pass and backward pass across all of your data at once.\n",
