    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Why do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world you could do the forward pass and backward pass across all of your data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you start using really large datasets, unless you've got infinite computing power, it's easier to break them up into batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also gives your model more opportunities to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **mini-batches** (small portions of the data), gradient descent is performed more often per epoch (once per mini-batch rather than once per epoch).\n",

Then plot some predictions where the model was wrong alongside what the label of the image should've been. After visualing these predictions do you think it's more of a modelling error or a data error? As in, could the model do better or are the labels of the data too close to each other (e.g. a \"Shirt\" label is too close to \"T-shirt/top\")?"

    "2. Search \"what is overfitting in machine learning\" and write down a sentence about what you find. \n",
    "3. Search \"ways to prevent overfitting in machine learning\", write down 3 of the things you find and a sentence about each. **Note:** there are lots of these, so don't worry too much about all of them, just pick 3 and start with those.\n",
    "4. Spend 20-minutes reading and clicking through the [CNN Explainer website](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/).\n",
    "    * Upload your own example image using the \"upload\" button and see what happens in each layer of a CNN as your image passes through it.\n",
    "5. Load the [`torchvision.datasets.MNIST()`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html#torchvision.datasets.MNIST) train and test datasets.\n",
    "6. Visualize at least 5 different samples of the MNIST training dataset.\n",
    "7. Turn the MNIST train and test datasets into dataloaders using `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, set the `batch_size=32`.\n",
    "8. Recreate `model_2` used in this notebook (the same model from the [CNN Explainer website](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/), also known as TinyVGG) capable of fitting on the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "9. Train the model you built in 8. on CPU and GPU and see how long it takes on each.\n",
    "10. Make predictions using your trained model and visualize at least 5 of them comparing the prediciton to the target label.\n",
    "11. Plot a confusion matrix comparing your model's predictions to the truth labels.\n",
    "12. Create a random tensor of shape `[1, 3, 64, 64]` and pass it through a `nn.Conv2d()` layer with various hyperparameter settings (these can be any settings you choose), what do you notice if the `kernel_size` parameter goes up and down?\n",
