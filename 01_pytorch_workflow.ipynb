        "\n",
        "1. Set the model in evaluation mode (`model.eval()`).\n",
        "2. Make the predictions using the inference mode context manager (`with torch.inference_mode(): ...`).\n",
        "3. All predictions should be made with objects on the same device (e.g. data and model on GPU only or data and model on CPU only).\n",
        "\n",
        "The first two items make sure all helpful calculations and settings PyTorch uses behind the scenes during training but aren't necessary for inference are turned off (this results in faster computation). And the third ensures that you won't run into cross-device errors."
