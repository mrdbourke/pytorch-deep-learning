        "So it's likely you'll run into various errors when using it.\n",

        "Because of the various maintenance and checks performed by the creators, it's rare the error will be because of the library itself.\n",

        "Don't be offended, this happens to every programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of the user errors you run into, chances are they'll be one of the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Shape errors** - You're trying to perform an operation on matrices/tensors with shapes that don't line up. For example, your data's shape is `[1, 28, 28]` but your first layer takes an input of `[10]`.\n",
        "2. **Device errors** - Your model is on a different device to your data. For example your model is on the GPU (e.g. `\"cuda\"`) and your data is on the CPU (e.g. `\"cpu\"`).\n",
        "3. **Datatype errors** - Your data is one datatype (e.g. `torch.float32`), however the operation you're trying to perform requires another datatype (e.g. `torch.int64`).\n",

You could also write functions to ensure your training code happens all on the same device, see [05.
