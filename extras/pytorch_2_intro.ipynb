    "### Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Fusion, also known as **operator fusion** is one of the best ways to make deep learning models go brrrrrr (brrrrrr is the sound your GPUs fan make when your models are training).\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator fusion condenses (like Dragon Ball Z) many operations into one (or many to less).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern GPUs have so much compute power they are often not compute limited, as in, the main bottleneck to training models is how fast can you get data from your CPU to your GPU.\n",
    "This is known as bandwidth or memory bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to reduce your bandwidth costs as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "And feed the data hungry GPUs with as much data as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/extras-memory-bandwidth-output-small.gif\" alt=\"example of memory bandwidth costs transferring data on and off the GPU\" width=950/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of performing an operation on a piece of data and then saving the result to memory (increased bandwidth costs), you chain together as many operations as possible via fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rough analogy would be using a blender to make a smoothie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most blenders are good at blending things (like GPUs are good at performing matrix multiplications).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a blender **without operator fusion** would be like adding each ingredient one by one and blending each time a new ingredient is added.\n",
    "Not only is this insane, it increases your bandwidth cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual blending is fast each time (like GPU computations generally are) but you lose a bunch of time adding each ingredient one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a blender **with operator fusion** is akin to using a blender by adding all the ingredients at the start (operator fusion) and then performing the blend once.\n",
    "\n",
    "You lose a little time adding at the start but you gain all of the lost memory bandwidth time back."

    "### Graph capture\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph capture I’m less confident explaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the way I think about is that graph capture or graph tracing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Going through a series of operations that need to happen, such as the operations in a neural network.\n",
    "* And capturing or tracing what needs to happen ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing **without graph capture** is like going to a new area and following GPS directions turn by turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a good human driver, you can follow the turns quite easily but you still have to think about each turn you take.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the equivalent to PyTorch having to look up what each operation does as it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in, to perform an addition, it has to look up what an addition does before it can perform it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this quickly but there’s still non-zero overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/extras-graph-capture.gif\" alt=\"Graph capture\" width=\"950\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example of graph capture, mapping out the steps in a neural network and then capturing every operation that needs to happen ahead of time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing **with graph capture** is like driving through your own neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "You barely think about what turns to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you get out of the car and realise you can’t remember the last 5 minutes of the drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your brain was functioning on autopilot, minimal overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it took you some time upfront to remember how to drive to your house.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a caveat of graph capture, it takes a little time upfront to memorize the operations that need to happen but subsequent computations should be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is a quick high-level overview of what’s happening behind the scenes of torch.compile()but it's how I understand it.\n",
    "\n",
